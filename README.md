  ## Description
  The reason I made this project is because the README.MD file could be easier made if it was automatically made with answering questions instead of creating the whole file every time you start a new project. Node.JS was the easy way to accomplish just the thing. All you need to do is start it and answer questions and it automatically makes the whole file with everything you answered.
